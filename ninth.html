                <p style="font-size: 13px; margin-top: -27px;">January 17, 2018</p>
               <p><span class="big-text">I</span>know you might be laughing at the use of the word ‘finishes’ in this context but truth be told that’s the way we say it most times. Away from Grammar, I’ve lost count of how many times I hear people say money doesn’t last for long and how they can’t even account for the money they got two days ago, these tales never end and truthfully, I’ve been a loyal victim myself until I was brave enough to find out the reasons and here’s some stuffs I found and Hey! don’t be scared, It’s not that bad, just follow through;</p>
      
               <img src="images/one (1).png" class="img-fluid" style="margin-left: 215px;">
               <p id="gray-paragraph"><b>LET ME GUESS, YOU’RE PROBABLY NOT GOOD WITH FINANCIAL BUDGET/PLANNING</b></p>

               <p>I know my guess is most likely correct, I’ve heard quite a number of views when it comes to this, while some believe it’s just a waste of time, some just say it doesn’t work for them since they generally find it difficult to follow written plans but you know what, I’ll say just <b> pen</b>  it down and let’s see if you won’t follow it. Writing down what you want to do with your money goes a long way, this just gives you a focus and direction when you finally get that long expected <b> Alert</b>  therefore saving you the trauma of spending it randomly. Before I started penning down what I want my money to do for me , I’ll generally just spend on expenses as it comes which in most cases Impulse buying and Transport fares (Duurh, It’s LAGOS) and before I know it, It’s finished and in most cases, I didn’t get to buy my essential needs and just at that time, the Glorious light of ‘PLANNING’ came upon me, I started planning in details from splitting the percentage that goes into Savings (30%)and the others that cover Expenses (60%), Giving(10%) and others. I even go as deep as breaking down to events I’ll be attending the next month and the amounts allocated to each division. If I forget to do this, I might just as well get punished, lol. Although, <b> Technology has made spending more money as easy as clicking one button</b>, but big Thanks to many financial Apps that makes this relatively easier such that you’re just a reminder away from your plan. Oh well, That’s some thoughts.</p>

               <p id="gray-paragraph"><b>IMPULSE/EMOTIONAL SPENDING</b></p>

               <p>Well I’ve come to realize that <b>expenses</b> don’t really care about how much you earn, it’s how you <b>spend</b> that matters most. That cup of coffee and box of donuts you buy randomly or that constant stop by at your favorite restaurant actually go a long way. Even those with high earnings find themselves living from paychecks to paychecks and so also for low income earners. <b>Impulse spending</b> means buying a bunch of unnecessary stuffs more like a <b>‘SHOPAHOLIC’</b> and <b>Emotional spending</b> comes in when you’ve probably had a bad/stressful day/week and you feel spending a few Naira on clothes or food will make you feel better. If you’ll agree with me, these things will give you the <b>‘feel good’</b> feeling you want at that moment and after that, that’s all. It could also be overspending in some situations such as travels, festivities.</p>

               <blockquote class="border"><p>The Holidays are over and before I went home, I practically wrote down everything I’ll be spending on and truthfully, I’m grateful I did. I could actually trace all my expenses and I still got my savings on track. (I’m really feeling myself….chuckles)</p></blockquote>

               <p id="gray-paragraph"><b>PAYING OFF DEBTS ON TIME</b></p>

               <p>I know the idea of paying off debts could be scary but what should scare you more is <b>BORROWING.</b> When it comes to funds or things you can totally do without, borrowing or taking loans should not be an option because it makes <b>saving</b> difficult. Should in case debts has to be incurred, cultivating the habit of early payment can actually lessen the burden. It might take some time, but it’s attainable.</p>

               <blockquote class="border"><p>I’ll make a brief description of what my budget plan looks like; I make use of my <b>Diary</b> and <b>Sticky pads</b> to pen down both the <b>expenses</b> and <b>income</b> I’ll be expecting the next month before the end of the previous month. I then use the 60%-40% to split; 60% - expenses, 20% -savings and 10% - tithes, I use Automated savings (<a href="https://www.piggybank.ng/" class="link">piggybank.ng</a>)so it makes savings relatively easy. I most importantly write what I’m saving for (Exams, Equipment) which basically gives me a <b>proper focus</b>  of what I want my money to do for me and lastly, I also write cases I have to default in case of an emergency or a craving (it happens).</p></blockquote>

               <p>I’m glad I could share some of these tips with you and I hope you find them quite easy to use and YES this is the first of many articles on personal finance, tech and anything that comes along. I’m willing to talk about money and young life and I hope you’ll love it. We ain’t <b>YOUNG & BROKE.</b></p>
