                <h2>WRITING CFA LEVEL I: A PERSONAL ANGLE</h2>
               <p><span class="big-text">F</span>or most people in the Finance field or even Finance enthusiast, writing and passing the CFA Exams is one of the biggest deals and YES, I’m not an exception. Earning the CFA Charter (that is, becoming a Charter holder), finally putting that three BOLD letters behind your name is a lifelong dream – however, like every good thing, it comes at a PRICE, and you must be willing and able to pay for it! I heard about the CFA exams during my undergraduate days and writing it then was one of those things I thought was well “far-fetched” for very obvious reasons, “<b>Money!</b>” After saving for a year or thereabout, I was finally able to afford registering for the exams (I said the exams, not the other expenses you may have to incur to help you in passing) – a classic case of, “<b>this life is not balance</b>”.</p>
      
               <p>My initial thought was that I could read all the 10 modules on my own, on the basis that I had background knowledge of some of the courses – but oh well, I quickly realized it was not an easy feat (after my initial failed attempt of using the financial calculator) and I registered for lectures at <b>Pure Factor Learning</b> as early as possible (another cost you may need to consider). First lesson: know what works for you in terms of learning. By the way, shout-out to everyone that did personal study for the exams, you are superstars! So, it boils down to knowing how you learn. If listening to someone else’s explanation makes you understand better, you have to decide either to get video learning materials from any of the CFA exam prep providers or register for physical class – you will agree that physical class pros weighs more than virtual learning where you may have no or limited access to the lecturers and/or ask question in real time. That said, if you read swiftly and understand faster on your own, then personal study will do you some good. I opted for physical classes. Truthfully, attending the 5 months long, weekend only lectures (even on holidays) was one of my biggest highlights while preparing for my level 1 exams. Luckily and thankfully, my class was a perfect blend of people. In class, were the Sarcastic, the Funny, the Lecturer’s pet, the Gentle, the Nice, the Efikos (don’t be threatened by them, you will be fine las las) and of course the Noisemakers – see, a perfect blend indeed! The lecturers were super good as well; from the Storyteller, the Extremely good, the Diplomatic, the “Explanationist” (lols), the Smooth talker, the Eye-candy and of course the Gentle. Some of my favorites quotes by some of them were “<b>Ori e pe!</b>” “<b>Plug & Play</b>” and “<b>Cheers</b>” – We particularly looked forward to hearing “Cheers” after every Ethics Class. I’m very grateful for everyone I met in class, exceptional people!</p>

               <p>Out of the 10 modules, I had favorites that was without argument “low-hanging fruits” (class inside joke) such as Fixed-Income securities and Economics; some other modules (e.g. Quantitative Methods), I just read to pass. Some of us used a technique called “<b>pick your struggle!</b>” The technique is about you picking modules you were most familiar with and then just focused on learning most, if not ALL the principles that could be tested – and please, no matter what happened, never joke with the Ethics module, it’s very key to exam success. For me, QM was one of those modules I was always like, why in God’s name does this course even exist? I remember I missed a particular QM class, (the ONLY class I missed in the entire 5 months, just to find time to make my hair, E be things!) and I totally ghosted the topic taught that day with the hope that it wouldn’t be relevant going forward. My dear, it’s a lie! it was, because it affected my understanding of other topics in the module. – anyways I passed! Point is, try your best to cover a significant chunk of all the modules even if you don’t finish the readings embedded. Also, learn each modules weighting, they will help you strategize how to structure your testing time. Never joke with learning objectives (LOS) – my classmate still make fun of me for always writing those on my notes; LOS will help you know what you need to learn in every topic and subject area. Infact, start every reading with learning the LOS. Another thing I was always laughed at was writing Date on my notes, I still don’t get why!</p>
               
               <p>One of the early essentials while preparing for the exams is also finding the “<b>Perfect</b>” study combination – trust me, learning from one source may not be sufficient. For me, I attended lectures, read the CFA curriculum and watched YouTube videos – it hastened my learning process. For some of my friends, their combo were; Lectures/Schweser notes/Videos; for others, Curriculum/Videos. The perfect combo is completely dependent on you and knowing it early helps you get started. Early reading is the best, although chances are that you will forget a good chunk of it, but it won’t appear new/strange when studying it again – you will also have ample time to go over topics/subject areas that you consider difficult if you start early. I will advise that you maximize the Learning Ecosystem (LES) for registered candidates (on the CFA website), make a habit of practicing the EOC questions even on the go. Practice a lot of CFA mock questions as your exam date draws near because they mirror what you will see on the exam day – so practice as many as you can. From the mock you can test and grade yourself as you prepare for the exam, the main goal is to learn so don’t beat yourself so hard if you’re not scoring more points at inception.</p>

               <p>Time! Time!! Time!!! You remember that time in school you thought you couldn’t combine any other thing to your academics because you were too “<b>busy?</b>” Try preparing for a major exam within months and at the same time joggling that with work and every other thing that comes with adulthood. So, discovering your convenient study time early enough is also expedient to your strategy on time – it could be early morning time before work, during lunch breaks or at night after work. For me, social life during exam prep was at an all-time low. I literally had nothing going on, the closest I had to any social gatherings was birthdays celebrated by classmates and class gist. There will be days where you won’t feel like it and you may start asking yourself questions. Some rainy Saturday morning, cool weather and occasional stress will make you ask yourself questions like “<b>why exactly am I going to class instead of sleeping at home?</b> “who send me sef?” My dear, you need to be prepared to answer questions like this so that you won’t find yourself withdrawing along the line. Such unanswered questions will most likely demotivate you, slow down your learning and eventually fear sets in! Every now and then, there’s the creeping and subtle fear of failure, it tingles the mind. The fear of “<b>what if I fail after I’ve spent money and time?</b>” If by any chance you experience this, know that it is completely normal – Don’t fret!. The most important thing is to try your ultimate best, dedicate time and effort and of course the undeniable <b>God</b> factor. It is also important to keep reminding yourself why you’re writing the exam, it will ultimately keep you going and sane.</p>

               <p>If you would be writing the Level I exams soonest, I wish you nothing but absolute success. It’s a long hurl my dear, but best believe you can do it! On the other hand, if you have similar experiences like this, feel free to share below.</p>

               <p>For me, as you already know “We move” onto the next level. Wish me GRACE!</p>
