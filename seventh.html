                <h2>ANOTHER SOCIAL MEDIA APP…. “VERO”</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 13px; margin-top: -27px;">March 19, 2018</p>
               <p><span class="big-text">T</span>he last decade has been defined by social media, for better and of course for worse. Several businesses and individuals have leveraged on the power of these tools to create huge presence, imagine a world without the likes of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram among others.</p>
      
               <p>These apps have added several other innovative features to the model it initially operated with, features consumers didn’t realize they needed until it was provided; ranging from an increase in character limits to 280 words on twitter to constant upgrade of Instagram story and interfaces and also the significant change in the total outlook of WhatsApp to a more user-friendly app through segmentation of different feature (voice & video call and chat) and also the WhatsApp status. Facebook also has had its own share of upgrade featuring the Facebook stories as well as Facebook live while Snapchat has added other filters all for better user experience.</p>

               <p>Facebook Inc. acquired Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 for a sum of $1billion and $19.6 billion respectively, the justification for the whooping sum paid to acquire WhatsApp was the Ad-free App’s projected growth which turned out to be a good buy seeing that it has over 1 billion users globally in 2017. The tech giant also considered acquiring the teen sensation Snapchat in 2013 for a sum of $3 billion due to a reduction in teenage users of Facebook but the offer was rejected. Google’s offer to buy Snapchat for a sum of $30 billion in 2016 was also declined. This indicates how far these tech giants are willing to go to acquire new Apps that pose as a competition.</p>

               <p>However, last month witnessed the dawn of a social media app called Vero, although the app isn’t brand new, its popularity exploded over the past weeks and it has been rumored as the new Instagram. Vero is an ad-free App founded in 2015 by billionaire businessman Ayman Hariri, it aims to put clean design and user experience first by eliminating unwanted ads and improving privacy by giving you power to control who sees your post and who doesn’t through its audience selector.</p>

               <p><i>Vero allows you post contents, chat, play music and shop online without leaving the App almost performing the functions of Instagram, Spotify and Amazon all at once. WeChat, a Chinese App provides services as such even more including hailing cab. This I believe is an amazing feature which will of course eliminate the need to download several other Apps.</i></p>

               <p>Vero topped the list of the most downloaded social media App on both Apple App store and Google play store and currently has over 3 million users globally dominated by millennials (ages 21–40) since its surge in February. Unlike Facebook & Twitter’s advertising model, Vero’s model is quite different, “it seeks to use annual subscription method to deliver the best social experience instead of trying to find new ways to monetize users’ behavior,” the website states. Vero states that it doesn’t mine data from its users, this I find very difficult to believe since data is said to be the oil of the 21st century, I wonder how a tech company will thrive without it.</p>

               <blockquote class="border"><p>Since we are constantly in search of a new ‘cool thing’ to add to our social portfolio, a social App capable of playing music, buying online and providing privacy such as Vero might as well be the new thing and as for Digital marketers, building up early presence on Vero could also be the next uplift.</p></blockquote>

               <p>I presume that if Vero further poses as a threat to other tech giants, lots of bids to acquire the social media App will be offered by competitors such as Facebook Inc, Google, Amazon and even Microsoft and if bids aren’t accepted, another IPO might just be on the way to join the FAANG stocks.</p>
