          <h2>INVESTING IN STOCKS; WHAT TO KNOW</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 13px; margin-top: -27px;">July 17, 2020</p>
         <p><span class="big-text">By</span> now, I‚Äôm very convinced that most Millennials knows what stocks/shares are and what exactly it means to own stocks and if you don‚Äôt know, here‚Äôs a <a class="link" href="https://medium.com/@Adeyojuwon/2019-time-to-tick-check-on-investing-995ff8eb972">link</a> to first-hand information. I‚Äôve also come to strongly believe that every young person wants to grow their money, the ‚Äòhow to go about it‚Äô remains the biggest challenge.</p>

         <p>Away from description and attempting to tackle the big challenge, let‚Äôs talk TRADING. Ever wondered what exactly trading of stocks means or better still how to make money from stock trading? For the purpose of the Article, this would be our focus.</p>

         <p>Firstly, let‚Äôs define <b>‚Äústock trading strategies‚Äù</b> ‚Äî trading strategy is simply how you choose to trade. There are two main strategies people use in trading.</p>

         <p>1.<b> Active Trading Strategy:</b> For this approach, people constantly and consistently look at the market to analyse stocks that are not fairly priced i.e. you have reasons to believe that the stock is not trading at its right price.</p>

         <p>When they realize that the stock is selling at an amount lower than what they think it should be (<b>Undervalued</b>), they buy the stock and in turn when they realize the stock is selling at a price they think is higher than what it should be selling (<b>Overvalued</b>), they sell the stock.</p>

         <blockquote class="border"><p>Example: Let‚Äôs assume the stock of Gtbank is trading at ‚Ç¶12.5 but for some reasons you believe it should be selling higher than that say ‚Ç¶14.0, it means you believe it is undervalued and that means you should buy. Same principle works for overvalued stocks.</p></blockquote>

         <p>If they succeed with this analysis, they‚Äôll obtain a higher return than people who don‚Äôt use this approach. Although Active trading can be very costly, it can help you take advantage of short-term opportunities in the market.</p>

        <p>2. <b>Passive Trading Strategy:</b> Simply put, for this strategy you <b>Buy and Hold</b> your stocks, usually for a long time period. Compared to active trading, passive trading is cheaper and less complex which means that potential to earn a higher return is limited.</p>

        <p>Now that you know the two main trading strategies, you can now decide which of the strategy you‚Äôd prefer and kick start your trading.</p>

        <p id="sub-topic">MAKING DECISIONS ON WHAT AND WHEN TO BUY/SELL‚Ä¶</p>

        <p>To make profit from stock trading, there‚Äôs the ‚Äú<b>timing factor</b>‚Äù which leads to the never-ending question of ‚Äú<b>when do I buy</b>‚Äù and ‚Äú<b>when do I sell</b>‚Äù. Just like any other business, the difference between how much you buy and how much you sell would be your profit/loss.</p>

        <p><b>WHAT THEN EXACTLY DO I BUY/SELL?</b></p>

        <p>If you didn‚Äôt know, there are about 630,000 stocks of several companies listed in different Exchanges across the world, with USA having the highest number. Technology has made it really easy to invest in stocks of your country and even international stocks. Now that you‚Äôve decided to invest in stocks, how do you narrow down your options? Based on sentiments? Yes?</p>

        <p>You would be surprised that an average person chooses stocks they are interested in based on sentiments. They go ‚Äú<b>I really like how Nike supports Black athletes, so I‚Äôll buy the stocks‚Äù, ‚ÄúI love the CEO of Tesla, he‚Äôs so free-spirited</b>‚Äù note that both of these reasons are not based on actual analysis just on sentiments</p>

        <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/AgHBbekqDik0g/giphy.gif" alt="gif"  class="img-fluid">

        <p>Although sentiments can be a good basis for investments, it is often times not enough reason to invest and that‚Äôs where your Analysis comes in (Don‚Äôt fear, you don‚Äôt have to calculate‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ or maybe you have toü§î). Speaking of analysis, there are two major methods of stock analysis to help make buy/hold/sell decisions.</p>

        <p>1. <b>FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:</b> Just like the name, this attempts to use all the ‚Äú<b>fundamental</b>‚Äù elements of a company to tell if buying/selling is a good decision. If I were to consider this approach, I‚Äôll be looking at all relevant public information about the company such as its revenues forecasts, projected growth rates, new relevant information (perhaps expansion plan), even the management of the Company as well as industry and economic data, such as inflation and interest rates.</p>

        <li><strong>Let‚Äôs bring this to relatable terms</strong> ‚Äî Say I‚Äôve particularly had my eyes on the Healthcare sector because for some reasons, I feel it‚Äôll always be an essential sector that people can‚Äôt do without even if commodity prices skyrockets (sentiments-based), by picking Healthcare sector, I have Industry selection checked.</li>

        <li id="list">Of course, I can‚Äôt stop there. I think to myself; would I prefer Pharmaceutical Firms or Biotechnology firms or Medical Supply firms or Medical Equipment Production Firms or Healthcare Facilities (Hospitals) or even Healthcare Insurance. Taking a moment to consider these, I go for <b>Pharmaceutical Firms</b> basing my decision on the fact that these companies has high turnover period because as you will agree with me Drugs sell faster than an MRI machine (full body scanner). And now, I have Sub-sector selection checked.</li>

        <li id="list">With my Sub-sector selection checked, I do a quick search for top pharmaceutical firms across the world. For example, international companies that derive a majority of their revenues from the sale of pharmaceuticals include <a class="link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVS/">Novartis AG</a>,<a class="link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFE/">Pfizer Inc.</a>,<a class="link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GSK/"></a> GlaxoSmithKline</a>, and <a class="link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNY/"> Sanofi-aventis S.A.</a> Top pharma companies in Nigeria include May & Baker Nigeria, GlaxoSmithKline Nigeria, Juli Plc and Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals. After comparing these companies, I‚Äôm eventually able to drive down my choices to two Companies; GSK and Sanofi based on relevant data.</li>

        <li id="list">Now, It won‚Äôt make much sense to put my money in two companies within the same sector, I have to pick either of the two. I compare both their revenues, look at their growth projections, check latest information about the companies to know what they‚Äôve been up to (<b>are they expanding or shutting down some aspects of the business</b>) and importantly who makes up their management team?</li>
  
        <li id="list">After carefully considering all of the above, I‚Äôve been able to come to a BUY decision for GSK.</li>

        <li id="list" style="padding-bottom: 23px;">You can‚Äôt tell me this isn‚Äôt fun to do. Over to you, pick an Industry you fancy and do a similar research exercise.</li>
        
        <blockquote class="border"><p><b>So where do I get information about companies I‚Äôm interested in?</b><a class="link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/"> Yahoo Finance,</a> Reuters and Bloomberg are very helpful resources for such information.</p></blockquote>
    
        <p>Also, if you don‚Äôt want to trade by yourself you can always reach out to a broker. They can provide buy/sell advises at a fee.</p>

        <p>2. <b>TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:</b> You know how they say, ‚Äú<b>Nothing is new under the Sun</b>‚Äù, this is a perfect way to describe what technical analysis is about. It uses historical trading information such as previous prices of the stock to predict what the future price of the stock will likely be. The belief is that market operates in cycles i.e.<b> it always repeats itself</b> therefore it is important to identify the patterns in prices. As you can tell, exploiting these patterns can be very tricky, costly and maybe difficult.</p>

        <p>If I were to use technical analysis for my pharmaceutical stock above, I wouldn‚Äôt need to do much research about the company, I might not even need to know what type of business they are into, its competitors or even any macro-economic factor as in Fundamental Analysis. I will only be looking at the prices the stock had traded in the past and the volumes traded and checking out for patterns in these trades.</p>
  
        <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/1AjFk7MzJBT2UPYKLB/giphy.gif" alt="gif" class="img-fluid">

        <p style="padding-top: 38px;">To study these patterns appropriately, technical analysts use several tools such as Charts, Trends, Cycles, Chart Patterns and Indicators. One of the tools I‚Äôve been able to get a hang of is ‚Äî Chart Patterns. Simply put, Chart Patterns create a recognizable shape in stock prices, they usually appear repeatedly. One of the many chart patterns technical analyst look out for is called Heads & Shoulders</p>

        <h3 style="color: gray;padding-top: 20px;">Head & Shoulders: This is an example of reversal pattern, it can show if a stock price that was going up (uptrend) will now come down (downtrend) or vice versa i.e. it‚Äôll show if stock prices will reverse.</h3>
