               <p><span class="big-text">It</span>still sounds abstract to a lot of people, myself included to say a company is worth a freaking sum of ‚Äú$1 trillion‚Äù but shortly after critically analyzing the effect the 42 years old company has had on consumer technology world, the curiosity gradually fades away and if you have any Apple device, then congrats you made it happen. Cheers!!</p>

               <p id="gray-paragraph">If Apple Were a Country. Source: Bloomberg</p>
               
               <p>Apple‚Äôs revenue over the past years has been a function of the huge success of its star products which includes; the iPhone, iPod, MacBook and most recently the wireless AirPods & HomePods. The publicly quoted company has been known as the Lord of producing clean & sophisticated hardware devices selling million of these products yearly, but of course, to amass wealth worth $1 trillion in market capitalization, you need more strategic ways to capture your market, more reason Apple ventured into the software business with products like Apple music, App store, iCloud & Siri all of which owns a good chunk of the market share as well.</p>

               <h3><b>The Big Question is What‚Äôs Next?</b></h3>

               <p>Regardless of its current size, the ‚Äúgoing concern‚Äù entity still holds true for Apple more than ever before, the company has to maintain lead in successful product offerings in the face of stiff market competition. Apple Music‚Äôs biggest competitor Spotify with 159 million active users recently announced that it had entered a long-term partnership with Samsung, therefore, for every new Samsung product you buy be it a smartphone, TV or speakers, a Spotify app is waiting for you.</p>

               <blockquote class="border"><p>This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean high daily usage for Spotify but where I come from, if you‚Äôre offered free services, you‚Äôre definitely using it.</p></blockquote>

               <p>To further stiffen the competition, Samsung remains the lead according to a report from IDC with the largest smartphone shipment worldwide while Apple, coming 3rd was beaten by Huawei (thanks to Africa I guess) as the 2nd largest shipper of smartphones in the second quarter of this year.</p>
               <p>The plus side to this remains that Apple‚Äôs products are quite pricey than its counterparts and yet it sells millions of it, hence, revenue remains high and then again large shipment does not automatically mean huge sales.</p>
              
               <p>The downside however is that Samsung being the lead has access to more consumers thereby signaling that Spotify through Samsung has huge chances of surpassing Apple Music the more and if Spotify chooses to partner with other Android phone makers, Apple‚Äôs music market will gradually dwindle.</p>
            
               <h3><b>FIERCE COMPETITION: GOOGLE, AMAZON AND MICROSOFT</b></h3>

               <img style="padding-top: 20px;" src="images/amazon.jpeg" class="img-fluid">
               <p id="gray-paragraph">L-R: HomePod by Apple, Echo by Amazon and Home Assistant by Google</p>

               <p>All of Apple‚Äôs products are threatened by other competitors, Its Siri is neck to neck with Amazon‚Äôs Alexa and Google Assistant, iCloud is threatened by Google drive & Dropbox while the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-smart-speakers/" class="link">HomePod</a>   (smart speakers) is currently battling with first comers like Amazon‚Äôs Echo & Google Home.</p>

               <p>Regulation on Data privacy is not smiling on Tech companies and Apple is not an exception. A little while back, Google was fined $5 billion by EU for abusing dominance on Androids. Though a chicken change to Google but increasing scrutiny & fines is not good business.</p>

               <blockquote class="border"><p>But then again its Apple, its constant product refresh & ‚Äòcrazy good‚Äô business strategies will make it stand out las las. Whether its Space Exploration, Driverless Cars</p></blockquote>

               <p>**With planned Initial Public Offering (IPO) scheduled for next year, Apple is almost sure to have a 4 commas club buddy as Saudi Aramco is expected to be valued at over $2 trillion making it the world‚Äôs most valuable listed company.</p>

               <p>**Speaking of $1 Trillion companies, did you know that we have a ‚Ç¶1 Trillion Nigerian company as well, I was surprised too. Guess?‚Ä¶. Its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GUARANTY:NL" class="link">GTBank</a> </p>

               <h4><b>Tesla: Going Private?</b></h4>
               <p>When you run a multi-billion dollar company and the future of cars and energy is hopefully in your hands, every of your tweet counts.</p>

               <img style="padding-top: 20px;" src="images/tesla.jpeg" class="img-fluid">
               <p id="gray-paragraph">CDO of Tesla ‚Äî Franz von Holzhausen. Source: Twitter</p>

               <blockquote class="border"><p>Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Inc tweeted last week about his thoughts of taking Tesla private at $420/share and a probable ‚Äúsecured funding‚Äù from other investors.</p></blockquote>
               
               <p>This got people talking about the possibility of the buyout by the company and if they can actually pull it off. Elon‚Äôs tweets has always indicated how less of a fan he is of the way publicly quoted are always pressurized by investors & regulations saying it‚Äôs always about the price and not the real value and future of the company, this prompted him to want to run the company after the model of his space exploration company; SpaceX which is also private.</p>
               
               <h4><b>Secured Funding?</b></h4>

               <p>To take Tesla private, huge funding would have to be raised by the company and from posts on the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/update-taking-tesla-private" class="link">company‚Äôs website,</a>  all lights points to the Saudi Arabian Sovereign Wealth Fund who is looking to invest hugely in Tesla as a means for them to divest from oil and secure a future in Electric cars. Smart country right, if only Nigeria can do the same.</p>

               <blockquote class="border"><p>If the buy-out is eventually successful, shareholders that wants to remain with Tesla has the chance to do so while those who doesn‚Äôt can sell their shares back at $420/per share. So far, the company‚Äôs shares has been surging and it‚Äôs currently $72.36 shy away from planned $420 although it‚Äôs being probed by SEC for authenticity of the ‚Äúsecured funding‚Äù.</p></blockquote>

               <p>As much as I know that Tesla is the future of cars, the company‚Äôs profit record is not reflecting it as it‚Äôs been making losses for a while. I hope the company gets itself together and I‚Äôll go dream of riding a red model S soon! (miracles happenüòúüòú)</p>

               <li id="list">*This is similar to <a href="https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/02/nse-approves-delisting-7-buyout-majority-shareholders/" class="link">7Up‚Äôs</a>   voluntary delisting from the Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE) earlier this year by its majority shareholder Affelka Holdings, they claim to want to restructure the company after facing huge losses during the recession. This comes 6 years after Coca-Cola delisted from NSE as well.</li>

               <p style="padding-top: 20px;">I appreciate you guys for reading, hoping to cover Nigeria tech scene as well especially about Google Nigeria‚Äôs free WiFi, I feel there‚Äôs a lot to it than we know of. Hints: It has to do with data.</p>
