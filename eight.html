                <h2>SLAY FESTIVAL WAS…AMAZING</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 13px; margin-top: -27px;">Febuary 19, 2018</p>
               <p><span class="big-text">A</span>fter successfully convincing myself to set aside my boring Saturdays schedules and for obvious fantastic reasons attend slay festival organized by She Leads Africa co-founded by my (silent) mentor Afua Osei, I owe myself a very good dinner and 5 straight hours watching FRIENDS for yielding to that silent voice that kept saying “just register already!”.</p>
      
               <p>I was quick to decide the classes I’ll be attending after seeing the long list of speakers & sessions cutting across several sectors, surely had to be relating to personal finance/investment and technology. Luckily, the classes had not started before my arrival.</p>

               <p>So, I got there some minutes past 2pm, the ambiance, the feel was amazing. From the entrance of TBS, I could sight stands of various vendors, Maggi (because of the free food, which I did’t get btw), SLA display banners and the beautiful yellow keke from the yellow of Lagos to showcase the beauty of the state. I went straight ahead to meet my friend (Tola) who was in a discussion with someone from <b>ARM financial advisers.</b> He described to us their new online product that enables users to easily buy money market instruments mostly mutual funds online through the App on mobile phones.</p>

               <blockquote class="border"><p><i>I believe this will increase financial access among millennials. At this age, we shouldn’t be physical at stockbroking firms before we’re able to trade in the market, technology should be deployed in this regard (post for another day).</i></p></blockquote>

               <p>My next stop was at a Personal savings class coordinated by <a href="https://medium.com/u/103c231a66ad?source=post_page-----d1683d01b86c----------------------" class="link"> Chidinma Okoli</a>  , I could tell immediately that I’ve come across her name before, thank God I remembered where it was from (<a href="https://medium.com/u/5b5d0f9fdbd?source=post_page-----d1683d01b86c----------------------" class="link">Edubridge Academy</a> ), I’m quite acquainted with most of what she taught but that didn’t make it any less interesting. However, I’m still surprised that a lot of people know little or nothing about the simplest form of investing/savings (another post again) still leading back to financial access among millennials.</p>

               <img src="images/damola.jpeg" class="img-fluid">
               <p id="gray-paragraph">Spot-on</p>

               <p>I then went around to take couple of pictures in front of my favorite brands including; waffle haus, bathkandy and I also did a sugar and BP test with Avon HMO, I might just have to consider their HMO plan, quite reasonable. Oh, they made fun of Tola for being scared of injections.</p>

               <p>At about 4:30 pm, it was just in time for a session with <a href="https://medium.com/u/965795e57e54?source=post_page-----d1683d01b86c----------------------" class="link">Akin Oyebode</a>  of Lagos Innovates. He took time to explain what Lagos has been doing for start-ups and the fact that LSETF isn’t willing to be the center but a complement to the likes of <a href="https://medium.com/u/cd1d06186e29?source=post_page-----d1683d01b86c----------------------" class="link"> Co-Creation Hub</a>. What particularly got my attention was the vouchers for office spaces with spaces such as <a href="https://medium.com/u/3d1545a12700?source=post_page-----d1683d01b86c----------------------" class="link">Workstation Nigeria</a>  amongst others. Well, as expected since Nigerians generally have bad vibes regarding anything that has to do with government, only 70 start-ups applied. The government needs more credibility among the people.</p>

               <blockquote class="border"><p><i>He mentioned a trend in the tech space which I believe anyone quite observant would have noticed as well; a large proportion of the participants in this space attended universities like Covenant university, Babcock university or better still schooled overseas and of course curious me asked him what would be the fate of public universities students if the trend continues? He stated that the aforementioned schools provides incentives for their students almost equivalent to their fees which is totally fine, the solution apparently isn’t something that’ll come anytime soon. Meanwhile, the area of personal development seems to be the short-term solution pending the unknown time NUC revises university’s curriculum or when people are willing to pay more to get incentives from schools.</i></p></blockquote>

               <p>Next stop was the Artificial Intelligence and machine learning class put together by <a href="https://medium.com/u/2a87c0008377?source=post_page-----d1683d01b86c----------------------" class="link">Kudi</a>. Truthfully, I enjoyed this session the most not only because the ladies there were beautiful and smart but also because Vivian gave a clear picture of what’s going on in AI evidenced in UBA’s virtual banker; LEO, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6-8DQALGt4" class="link">Alexa</a>  created by Amazon, almighty self-driving cars by Uber, Apple watch amongst several others.</p>

               <blockquote class="border"><p>This actually reminded of one Estonian start-up I did a little research on last year named Weps, it’s a chat bot that creates your website within 5 minutes based on the information you provide…Amazing stuffs, Nigeria cannot even carry last.</p></blockquote>

               <p>Although, this space is fast growing, it still requires loads of professionals (data scientist) according to an article I read from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/technology/artificial-intelligence-experts-salaries.html?action=click&contentCollection=Technology&module=RelatedCoverage&region=Marginalia&pgtype=article" class="link">The New York Times</a>. So, if you’re up to learn more, there are online courses available to take and also Data Science Nigeria is getting a way to increase its awareness through boot camps & summits.</p>

               <p>Conclusively, I had an amazing time, I caught a glimpse of some celebrities; Waje, Omotola, Stephanie Coker, Adenrele Sonariwo (Rele Art Gallery), Funke Opeke and my (silent) mentor Afua Osei. I waited for the performance of Show dem camp which I was really looking forward to just to flaunt the fact that I can sing (It’s up to you) line by line but somehow sha, they didn’t perform. I really wish SLA gave us a souvenir tho, even a pen is cool so that when they ask me at home what I brought back, I could show them a SLAY pen!!.</p>

               <p>Thanks for reading…. Carpe Diem!!</p>
